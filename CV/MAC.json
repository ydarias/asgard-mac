          "description": "We were ninety minutes into a one-hour job interview when the CTO said “We like your _breadth_ of experience. Now we’d like to test your _depth_. If we gave you a quick programming assignment, which would you prefer — writing an iOS app, or an Android app? You should go with the one you’re stronger in.”\n\nI’m a much stronger iOS programmer than an Android one. The smart move would’ve been to answer “iOS,” and be done with it.\n\nInstead, I replied “Yes, but you want a guy who can lead a team of both iOS and Android developers. You really should give me both.”\n\nThe CTO raised an eyebrow, gave me a look, made a note on his pad, and said “Hmmm...I think I will.”\n\nThis is either a “total baller move” (to borrow a turn of phrase the kids are using these day), or the end of that job prospect. But for the job that they’re trying to fill, taking on that challenge was the right thing to do.\n\nIt had been a couple of years since I’d touched C or Objective-C, but after bumping my head once or twice against C-isms (“Oh yeah, pointers”), I got into a groove and a few days later, I had an app that I could show them.\n\nI sent them my project files for the iOS app, along with this “highlight reel” of the app in action, which I made using Camtasia Studio. “Tell me what you think while I work on the Android version.”\n\nAnd that’s the last I heard from them. Follow-up emails were met with silence. After the 6th email (“If you have any questions or comments about the app, please feel free to contact me”), it became apparent that this was a dead end, and it wouldn’t be worth my while to continue working on the Android version. Perhaps I’ll work on it as a way to sharpen my Kotlin skills.",

It's 5 minutes long, with 20 slides, each slide advancing automatically every 15 seconds. The format has been described as \"the presentation equivalent of a haiku or sonnet.\" They're more challenging than your typical presentation, and require more rehearsal -- and they're also more thrilling to give!",

As a community leader in that scene, I showed up in a number of these videos.\n\nThis Byte Club episode covered DemoCamp Toronto, a monthly show-and-tell gathering where Toronto techies could demo their projects in front of an audience of their peers. I was one of the people who co-hosted these gatherings.\n\nYou had a time limit to present, and no slides were allowed at DemoCamp — you could only show your project in action!",
