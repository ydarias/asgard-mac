It was a peer-to-peer encrypted proxy system that circumvented internet censorship systems such as “The Great Firewall of China”, and has since been supplanted by VPN and similar anti-censorship technologies.\n\nEven though it was announced, the project wasn’t actually implemented until Paul Baranowski and I worked on it starting December 2001, and presented it at the CodeCon conference in February 2002. Paul was the back-end developer, building the underlying networking software, while I was the front-end developer, and built and designed the user interface, which included the cute bear icons that the screen used to show other users on the network.\n\nPeekabooty got a considerable amount of press at the time. Here’s a short list of articles: - _The Register:_ [Censor-buster Peek-A-Booty goes public](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/02/18/censorbuster_peeka_booty_goes_public/) - _Neowin:_ [Peek-A-Booty raises a few eyebrows at CodeCon](https://www.neowin.net/news/peek-a-booty-raises-a-few-eyebrows-at-codecon) - From the book _[Hacktivism and Cyberwars: Rebels with a Cause?:](https://www.amazon.com/Hacktivism-Cyberwars-Rebels-Tim-Jordan/dp/0415260043/ref=sr_1_1)_ I am briefly mentioned on page 102 for my involvement with Peekabooty. - _Spiegel Online:_ [Vorhang auf für Peek a Booty:](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/tech/im-zeichen-des-teddies-vorhang-auf-fuer-peek-a-booty-a-183280.html) Peekabooty, as covered by the online version of the German news magazine _Der Spiegel_.",

If we gave you a quick programming assignment, which would you prefer — writing an iOS app, or an Android app? You should go with the one you’re stronger in.”\n\nI’m a much stronger iOS programmer than an Android one. The smart move would’ve been to answer “iOS,” and be done with it.\n\nInstead, I replied “Yes, but you want a guy who can lead a team of both iOS and Android developers. You really should give me both.”\n\nThe CTO raised an eyebrow, gave me a look, made a note on his pad, and said “Hmmm...I think I will.”\n\nThis is either a “total baller move” (to borrow a turn of phrase the kids are using these day), or the end of that job prospect. But for the job that they’re trying to fill, taking on that challenge was the right thing to do.\n\nIt had been a couple of years since I’d touched C or Objective-C, but after bumping my head once or twice against C-isms (“Oh yeah, pointers”), I got into a groove and a few days later, I had an app that I could show them.\n\nI sent them my project files for the iOS app, along with this “highlight reel” of the app in action, which I made using Camtasia Studio. “Tell me what you think while I work on the Android version.”\n\nAnd that’s the last I heard from them. Follow-up emails were met with silence. After the 6th email (“If you have any questions or comments about the app, please feel free to contact me”), it became apparent that this was a dead end, and it wouldn’t be worth my while to continue working on the Android version. Perhaps I’ll work on it as a way to sharpen my Kotlin skills.",

          "description": "I gave this presentation -- the second-last of the evening -- at Ignite Tampa Bay 2015, which took place in Tampa's Cuban Club on Thursday, August 27, 2015. In it, I sang the praises of \"Florida Man\" and \"Florida Woman\", those staples of slow news days and internet memes, and showed how they're this state's most valuable resource, complete with Florida Man logic and a closing accordion number.\n\nThis was a presentation given in the \"Ignite\" format. It's 5 minutes long, with 20 slides, each slide advancing automatically every 15 seconds. The format has been described as \"the presentation equivalent of a haiku or sonnet.\" They're more challenging than your typical presentation, and require more rehearsal -- and they're also more thrilling to give!",

I’d heard that Google wasn’t going to sponsor them, and asked: _\\_Why doesn’t Microsoft sponsor them instead?\\__\n\nI used the event as an opportunity to showcase Windows as a great development platform for Android, by demoing an HP touchscreen computer set up as an Android development station running Eclipse (which at the time was the preferred Android IDE) and also showing the Windows Phone development environment, which looked a lot less confusing and more aesthetically pleasing than Eclipse (although that’s easy), and showing the C# language (similar to Java, so it seems familiar) and Windows Phone in the process.",
